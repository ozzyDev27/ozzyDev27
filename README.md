Hi, Iâ€™m 
## ozzy!
### I am just someone who is learning to code -
I am not taking a course, not watching videos, nothing! Just having fun with coding and seeing where that leads me!
### The langauge I am learning is
Python! I am having a lot of fun with it, although I still use Scratch to create games.
On my first week of learning Python, I decided that I needed a large project to learn the language, and what is better than making my own?
### Vipr
Vipr is basically the project that defines me, as I have been working on it for 2 years now. It is a low-level language, and I'm currently working on making an online IDE for it!
